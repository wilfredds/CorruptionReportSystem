/**
 * What this week is for, and when it lets up.
 *
 * A plan tells you what to do today. A coach also tells you why, and — more
 * importantly for anyone training alone — when it stops. The weeks people skip
 * are the ugly ones in the middle of a build block, and they skip them because
 * from the inside an eight-week program is indistinguishable from an infinite
 * one. Naming the block and pointing at the deload turns "this is relentless"
 * into "this is week two of three".
 *
 * Derived from the enrolment rather than stored, so it cannot drift out of step
 * with the plan the same function generated.
